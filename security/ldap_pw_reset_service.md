            ~~~
            The user account can only be used for standard password change, when user is giving its old password. For other password changes (token, questions, â€¦), manager account will always be used, whatever value is set in $who_change_password.
            ~~~
* Configure Email

    * Notice that Google SMTP relay service has to be configured that smtp-relay.gmail.com host can be used.

* Now sending a reset email should work, but if one doesn't enable TLS on AD LDAP, AD will refuse to reset a password.
    * Error: Password was refused by the LDAP directory
* Next step is to enable LDAPS and maybe set `$reset_url` if behind reverse proxy.
